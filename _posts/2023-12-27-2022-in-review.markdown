Big changes for the Shireys in 2023!

In May (on his 14th birthday, even!), Reed broke his collarbone. This makes three of the four of us who have broken their clavicle:

We made it back to Minnesota this summer, and each of the boys had a project with Grandpa Sam. Reed made a chess board out of black walnut and maple:

Jake made a black walnut table that is now sitting in his bedroom:

In June, Reed graduated from McKnight Middle School:

Jake is a sophomore at Renton High School, and Reed is now a freshman:

Thare are both in _a capella_ together and are doing wonderfully. They went to homecoming with some friends, old and new:

After more than a decade, we finally made it to Vancouver this fall.

Jake started fencing at [Washington Fencing Academy](https://www.washingtonfencing.com/) in Issaquah. He _loves_ it, and he's always asking the instructors probing questions that help him improve:

Our nephew Toby came to visit us this summer, and the family went to Mount Rainier (and almost made it to [Panorama Point](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/panorama-point-via-skyline-trail)):

Among other hikes, Adam did [Old Snowy Mountain](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/old-snowy-mountain-via-snowgrass-trail) with a friend, catching a [glimpse of Mount Baker, Mount Adams, and Mount Rainier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXMyHJiYMrA) from the summit. Joe put together [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAW-vEAx9oc) of the experience.

He also hiked Mount Si to spread the ashes of our friend and neighbor, Tony:

We spent a lot of time this year as a family watching [NHK Grand Sumo](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/sumo/). Jake is a huge [Wakatakakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakatakakage_Atsushi) fan!

We started checking out the various [Northwest Trolls](https://www.nwtrolls.org/)

And we made sure to go see Weezer at the White River Ampitheatre =W=

Since mid October, we've been doing some [deliberate cold exposure](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance), hopping into Puget Sound at Alki every Saturday morning.
