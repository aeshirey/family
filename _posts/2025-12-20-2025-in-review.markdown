Another year come and gone, we had happiness and sadness this year. We said goodbye to our wonderful doggo, hiking buddy, and best snuggler, Shasta. We rescued her back in 2014 from Salty Dog Rescue, and she instantly became everyone's favorite. Unfortunately, she developed cancer that we couldn't treat.

This May, Reed turned 16, and in August, he got his driver's license. (No photos of the momentous occasion.) He's become pretty interested in chemistry this year and is thinking about exploring further education and maybe a career in the field.

Then in July, Jake turned 18. He got to vote with Adam & Andrea for the first time. He's particularly happy this year with how much his drawing skills have improved (though he opted to not share any of them for now).

Andrea is on the cusp of getting her LMHC licensure - just waiting on the WA DOH to complete the paperwork! She's been enjoying her career at Salveo and is thinking about her career.

Adam has been in Xbox for a year and is enjoying the work, the challenges, the team, and more. Outside of work, there's been a lot of baking, some very slow progress in French, a little bit of brewing and distilling, and a few other side projects.

Early this year, we went to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with the rest of the Shireys to celebrate Mom & Dad's 50th wedding anniversary. We had fun relaxing by the pool and on the beach, and we got to visit some spectacular sights like Las Islas Marietas.

In late June and early July, the four of us went with Andrea's parents to France.

Andrea got to dip her feet in the Mediterranean.

After a week in the south, we went to Normandy for a much-needed break from the heat. After that, it was back to Paris.

We went back to the Louvre, and instead of exploring and seeing the Mona Lisa again, Jake decided he wanted to practice his art. He spent nearly two hours drawing the Venus de Milo (and he even had some small crowds watching him, to boot).

After we returned from France, we went back to Minnesota for a family visit. A friend of ours took Jake's senior photos.

Adam took a few motorcycle trips with friends including the Isle of Vashon TT ride by [Vintage Motorcycle Enthusiasts](https://vmemc.org/).

The other, bigger trip was a circuit through Chelan.

Reed has done some hiking this year, both day hikes and overnight backpacking. [Monte Cristo Ghost Town](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/monte-cristo-143) is a regular trip for him, and it usually involves an extra, particularly grueling hike up into the mountains (almost to [East Wilmans Spire](https://www.summitpost.org/east-wilmans-spire/153254)).

After a wonderful 10+ years there, we sold our Renton house.

And now it's just the Maple Valley house - though Jake will be graduating in six months, and Reed will a year later. We'll see what the future holds for us then.

In October, we 'celebrated' two years of weekly cold plunges at Alki. The crowd changes from time to time, but Vince and I are always there, rain or shine.

As for entertainment, we saw a few bands (Primus, A Perfect Circle), numerous comedians (including Steve Martin & Martin Short, Demetri Martin, and others), Hamilton, and of course a few of our boys' choir concerts.

There's also our weekly trivia which, near the end of 2024, we thought might come to an end with the closure of The Hop Garden. After a few months at a new location, we switched to another night at [Brewmaster's Taproom](https://brewmastersco.com/pages/the-taproom) in Renton. Delicious beer, great friends, and frequent ups and downs.

For 2026, we're looking forward to Jake's graduation, Reed's senior photos, more excitement with Andrea's career, more motorcycle rides (and probably a new motorcycle), a vacation to Scotland, plenty of code to be written, more cold plunges and trivia, and on and on.
