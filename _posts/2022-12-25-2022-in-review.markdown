2022 was a great year for us. We started off with Adam and the boys going to Klondike with the scout troop for a night of snow camping.

The boys did some climbing this year but have put that on hold while they pursue other interests.

Adam and Andrea got a few hikes in together, such as this one at [Little Si](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/little-si):

Adam and Reed did a six-country tour in almost three weeks in June. Reed is an amazing traveler, up for just about any adventure, including Munich's famous [Hofbräuhaus](https://www.hofbraeuhaus.de/en/welcome.html) and biking in Amsterdam:

We finally made it to our first Seahawks game in December; most the time, though, we just watch from the comfort of some gracious friends's living room.

Jake started 9th grade at Renton High School, and Reed's in 8th grade at McKnight Middle School:

Jake joined _a capella_ choir this year. He and his friend Dylan had a concert in November, and we're looking forward to the next one.

Our Thursday night trivia team, "I'm just here so I don't get fined," has done pretty well. The boys join occasionally, but usually it's Adam, Andrea, and the crew from St. Andrew.

Last year, Jake worked with Grandpa Sam to restore a double-bit axe he found, and we picked up some hefty cedar logs that Jake could use to practice his swing.

Meanwhile, Reed earned his fishing merit badge which included doing a lot of fishing with Grandpa, learning to clean and cook the fish, and then eat them.

Reed took 'consumer and family sciences' (known to many of us as 'home economics') at school, and he's learned a lot about sewing and cooking. He made his own hammock gear, and he and Adam hammock camped with the scout troop at [Monte Cristo](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/monte-cristo-143).

Among other things, Reed has learned to cook _sous vide_ steak, omelettes, Käsespätzle, beef stew, and homemade pizza, all pictured here:

Speaking of hammock camping: Adam did [a backpacking trip along the Pacific coast](https://photos.app.goo.gl/qiArdi37t9vBP8fr8) with friends, sleeping on the beach.

In August, Adam and some friends celebrated the memory of our friend Keith by finishing aging his smoked scotch.

Shasta is living her best life. She caught a whiff of her Christmas gifts and wouldn't let it go until she got to open one early. (It was a tennis ball!)

Andrea has completed four of six terms of her Master's program at Northwest University in Kirkland. Her degree is Clinical Mental Health Counseling, and she's working with children and families at [Sound Health](https://www.sound.health/).

For 2023, we're looking forward to more travel, Andrea's graduation, Jake learning to drive, Reed entering high school, and more adventures in- and outdoors!
