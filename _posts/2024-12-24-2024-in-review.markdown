Twenty twenty-four was another exciting year for us! Jake is currently a junior at Tahoma High School, and Reed is a sophomore. Andrea has been at Salveo for more than a year and is enjoying her work. Adam moved to a role within Xbox this December and is looking forward to new challenges there.

This summer, we celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary by spending the weekend at Salish Lodge in Snoqualmie:

We also went to numerous concerts. Several of us from our trivia group saw Collective Soul and Hootie & The Blowfish:

Adam, Jake, and Reed made an overnight road trip to Portland to see Colm McGuinness. There was also Primus, La Femme, Weezer, and of course, Foo Fighters:

We also got a few motorcycle trips in. Reed loves to join us:

A few times, we've had around a half dozen of us on a nice long trip:

And sometimes it's just a couple of us:

In September, Adam & Andrea went to Hawaii and Japan. Here we are on a luau at the end of the Hawaii leg of the trip:

We also spent several hours snorkeling off the coast of Waikiki (with [a fun interaction with a pod of dolphins](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kdjofEp3Jc57FwmW9)):

After Oahu, we made it to Tokyo, then Chichibu (to the west of Tokyo), then to Aomori (at the north of Honshu), and finally back to Tokyo. Among many, many other amazing things we saw and did, we hiked [Mount Iwaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Iwaki):

And, topping off the trip, we attended Day 10 of the sumo tournament, watching (nearly?) every one of our favorite wrestlers (especially [Wakatakakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakatakakage_Atsushi)) win their bouts:

Reed and Adam still regularly bake, and now that he has his very own Japanese-forged kitchen knife, he very jumps at the opportunity to don his chefs hat and apron:

[<img alt="Chef and sous chef - you decide who is whom" src="media/2024/chefs.jpg" width="50%" />](media/2024/chefs.jpg)

He also started driving lessons this summer and is clocking in many hours behind the wheel - especially because it required four weekly trips from Maple Valley to Renton and back, giving us lots of time in the car together. Unfortunately, he wasn't as enamored with The Proclaimers's hit single, _I'm Gonna Be_, as Adam is:

[<img alt="One of us grew up in the 90s" src="media/2024/proclaimers.jpg" width="50%" />](media/2024/proclaimers.jpg)

Both boys are still in choir and have had a couple concerts at Tahoma High School:

Jake got into Halloween more this year than usual, hanging out on the front step to scare kids (which is more socially acceptable on October 31st than other days):

He's improved his already incredible drawing skills immensely. Even [the recent bomb cyclone](https://apnews.com/article/california-oregon-washington-storm-power-outages-aadbd4863dd989189d31c1c2187b5025) that left us without power for a few days couldn't keep him from drawing:

Nearly every Saturday, we still go to Alki for our 15 minute cold plunges. Sun or clouds, windy or calm, bright or dark, at least two of us are there to get cold and enjoy each other's company:

As we come up on one year in our Maple Valley house, we're still working on various improvements. The biggest has been ripping out (nearly) all the carpet and putting in new flooring:

[<img alt="The living room nearly complete" src="media/2024/flooring.jpg" width="50%" />](media/2024/flooring.jpg)

Scope creep is always a probem. We figured that since we were redoing the floors, it made sense to also paint all the walls. Andrea did the majority of the work, but we did have a little unexpected help from Shasta:

[<img alt="Shasta with paint on her feet" src="media/2024/shasta paint.jpg" width="50%" />](media/2024/shasta paint.jpg)

She's taken to the new house (though the lack of carpet has made her traction a bit tougher). Mostly, I think she is just glad that we're here with her:
